[circle]
Let's draw a circle.

A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the center

[diameter]
Now let's draw a diameter.

A diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle.
We mark its endpoints with A and B.

[point]

Now pick a point C anywhere on the circle, different from A and B.

[triangle]

Let's construct a triangle using the diameter as one side and going through C.
